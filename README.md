# Digital Ocean backend server

There is the source for the backend server of project OctoShark created during **DigitalOcean Cloud Hack 2016.**
When we recieve ``GET`` request from the user on ``@/create endpoint,`` through the chrome extension which is then parsed according to the user query and a 'ubuntu docker' droplet is created.
