# Digital Ocean backend server

There is the source for the backend server, created for project OctoShark during DigitalOcean Cloud Hack 2016.
When we recieve the 'GET' request from the user on @/create endpoint, we parse the user query and create 'ubuntu docker' droplet according to the user query.
